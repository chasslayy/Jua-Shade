# 🖤 JuaShade: Inclusive Skin Tone Detection Using Computer Vision

JuaShade is a computer vision project focused on inclusive skin tone detection and classification.
The goal of this project is to explore how machine learning and image processing techniques can be used
to analyze and categorize diverse skin tones in a fair and responsible manner.

This project was developed as part of a graduate-level Computer Vision course and emphasizes ethical AI,
dataset representation, and fairness-aware evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset Note

Due to dataset size and licensing constraints, **image files are not included** in this repository.

To run the code, users must provide their own dataset organized according to the directory structure shown above.
Each folder should contain images corresponding to its skin tone category.

Image paths in the notebook may need to be updated to match the local file system.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Open the Notebook

Open the notebook locally using Jupyter Notebook **or** upload it to Google Colab:

```
JuaShade_SkinTone_Colab_clean.ipynb
```

### 3. Update Dataset Path

At the top of the notebook, update the dataset path variable to point to your local `data/` directory.

### 4. Run All Cells

Execute the notebook cells **in order** to perform preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
